As an AI language model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as videos directly. However, I can provide you with a placeholder text that you might use as a reference in your code to represent the video file. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this placeholder with the actual binary data of your video file.

If you were to reference `assets/videos/video1.mp4` in your HTML, it might look something like this:

```html
<video id="videoPlayer" controls>
  <source src="assets/videos/video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

Please replace the placeholder text with the actual video content when you are deploying the website.
