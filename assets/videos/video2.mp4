Since the file requested is a binary video file (assets/videos/video2.mp4), I cannot generate code for it. Video files contain binary data that represents the video content and are not created or manipulated through code in the same way as text-based files like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

If you need to include this video in a webpage, you would reference it in an HTML file using the `<video>` tag, like so:

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="assets/videos/video2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

However, the actual content of video2.mp4 would be created using video editing software and then uploaded to the specified directory on the server.
