# Deployment Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy the website to the specified URL. It assumes that you have already followed the instructions in the [uploading guide](uploading.md) and [administration guide](administration.md) to prepare your website for deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure that you have the following:

- Access to the deployment environment.
- The `deploymentConfig` file with the necessary configuration details.
- The latest build of the website ready for deployment.

## Steps for Deployment

### 1. Review the Deployment Configuration

Check the `deploymentConfig` file to ensure that all the settings are correct for the target environment. This file should include the `baseURL` where the website will be hosted.

```yaml
baseURL: "https://www.example.com"
# Other deployment configurations...
```

### 2. Validate Asset Names

Run the `validateAssetName` function to ensure all assets adhere to the naming conventions defined in the [naming conventions guide](naming_conventions.md).

```javascript
validateAssetName(assetPrefix, 'logo.png'); // Replace 'logo.png' with your asset's filename
```

### 3. Generate Links for Assets

Use the `generateLink` function to create correct links for all assets. This function will prepend the `baseURL` to your asset paths.

```javascript
let assetLink = generateLink(baseURL, 'images/logo.png'); // Replace 'images/logo.png' with your asset's path
```

### 4. Deploy the Website

Execute the `deploySite` function to start the deployment process. This function will use the settings from the `deploymentConfig` to deploy the website to the specified URL.

```javascript
deploySite(deploymentConfig);
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

After the deployment process is complete, verify that the website is accessible at the `baseURL` and that all links and assets are functioning correctly.

## Post-Deployment

Once the website is deployed, follow the [maintenance guide](maintenance.md) to set up a routine for regular checks and updates. Log any maintenance activities using the `logMaintenanceActivity` function as per the `MaintenanceLogSchema`.

```javascript
logMaintenanceActivity(MaintenanceLogSchema, {
  activity: 'Deployment',
  status: 'Successful',
  date: new Date().toISOString(),
  notes: 'Deployed to production environment.'
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment, refer to the error messages and consult the [administration guide](administration.md) for troubleshooting steps. Use the `UploadErrorMessage` and `MaintenanceUpdateMessage` to communicate any problems or updates.

For further assistance, contact the support team or refer to the [dashboard manual](dashboard_manual.md) for details on using the administration dashboard to resolve issues.
