# Administration Guide

Welcome to the administration guide for our website. This document outlines the procedures and tools required to administer the website effectively.

## Accessing the Administration Dashboard

To access the administration dashboard, navigate to the `/admin` section of the website by appending `/admin` to the `baseURL`. Ensure you have the necessary credentials to log in.

```html
<a href="${baseURL}/admin">Admin Dashboard</a>
```

## Using the Dashboard

Once logged in, you will see the main dashboard interface identified by the `adminDashboard` ID. The dashboard is designed to give you a quick overview of the site's status and allows you to manage content, users, and settings.

### Dashboard Initialization

Upon accessing the dashboard, the `initializeDashboard` function is called to set up the interface with the necessary data and controls.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeDashboard);
```

## Uploading Content

To upload new content, locate the `uploadForm` on the dashboard. Fill in the required fields and select the file you wish to upload. Use the `validateAssetName` function to ensure the asset name adheres to our `AssetNamingSchema`.

```javascript
document.getElementById('uploadForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Validate and upload logic here
});
```

## Managing Users

User management can be done through the dedicated section in the dashboard. Here you can add, remove, or modify user roles and permissions.

## Site Settings

Adjust site-wide settings such as themes, plugins, and `baseURL` through the settings panel. Ensure changes are saved and tested before applying them to the live site.

## Maintenance Logs

Maintenance activities can be tracked using the `maintenanceRecords` element. Use the `logMaintenanceActivity` function to add new entries to the `MaintenanceLogSchema`.

```javascript
function updateMaintenanceLog(activity) {
    logMaintenanceActivity(activity);
    document.getElementById('maintenanceRecords').innerHTML += `<p>${activity}</p>`;
}
```

## Handling Errors

In case of errors during administration tasks, appropriate messages defined by `UploadErrorMessage` and `MaintenanceUpdateMessage` should be displayed to the administrator.

```javascript
function showError(message) {
    alert(message);
}
```

## Logging Out

To log out of the administration dashboard, use the logout function provided within the dashboard interface. This will ensure that all sessions are properly terminated.
