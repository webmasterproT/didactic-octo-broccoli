# Software Requirements

This document outlines the software requirements necessary for the upload, administration, and maintenance of the website as described in the documentation.

## Core Software

- **Web Server**: A web server such as Apache or Nginx is required to serve the website files.
- **Database**: A database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store website data if dynamic content management is needed.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control and collaboration among developers.

## Development Tools

- **Text Editor/IDE**: A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom for writing and editing code.
- **Node.js**: Required if the website uses a Node.js-based framework or for using npm packages.
- **Build Tools**: Tools like Webpack or Gulp for asset compilation and bundling.

## Content Management System (CMS)

- **CMS**: If a CMS like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla is used, ensure the server meets the CMS's requirements.

## Asset Management

- **Image Editor**: Software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP for creating and editing visual assets.
- **FTP Client**: An FTP client like FileZilla for uploading assets to the server if not using a CMS or version control deployment.

## Administration and Maintenance

- **SSH Client**: A tool like PuTTY or the native SSH client in Unix-based systems for secure remote server access.
- **Database Management Tool**: phpMyAdmin or a similar tool for database administration.
- **Monitoring Software**: Software to monitor server health and performance, such as Nagios or New Relic.

## Deployment

- **CI/CD Tool**: Continuous integration and deployment tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions for automated deployment processes.
- **Cloud Services**: If deploying to cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, the respective CLI tools and SDKs are required.

## Dashboard

- **Dashboard Software**: If using a custom dashboard, ensure the necessary runtime environment is set up, e.g., Node.js for a JavaScript-based dashboard.

## Shared Dependencies

- **Base URL**: Ensure that the `baseURL` variable is configured in the environment or configuration files for constructing absolute paths.
- **Asset Naming**: Follow the `AssetNamingSchema` as described in `docs/naming_conventions.md` for consistent asset naming.
- **Deployment Configuration**: Set up the `deploymentConfig` with the correct parameters as outlined in `docs/deployment_guide.md`.

## Additional Dependencies

- **Browser**: A modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari for testing and administration purposes.
- **Code Linting Tools**: ESLint or JSHint for JavaScript code quality and consistency.
- **Dependency Management**: Composer for PHP, Bundler for Ruby, or other language-specific package managers.

Please refer to `docs/README.md` for an overview of the documentation, `docs/structure.md` for the website structure, and other documentation files for specific guidelines and procedures.
