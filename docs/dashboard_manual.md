# Dashboard Manual

Welcome to the Dashboard Manual. This document provides instructions on how to use the administration dashboard to manage the website effectively.

## Initializing the Dashboard

To initialize the dashboard, call the `initializeDashboard` function. This function will set up the dashboard with the necessary data and controls.

```javascript
initializeDashboard();
```

## Uploading Assets

To upload assets through the dashboard, locate the form with the ID `uploadForm`. Fill in the required fields and submit the form to upload the files.

```html
<form id="uploadForm" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <!-- Input fields for the upload form -->
</form>
```

Upon successful upload, `UploadSuccessMessage` will be displayed. If an error occurs, `UploadErrorMessage` will be shown.

## Administering the Website

The dashboard element with the ID `adminDashboard` provides access to various administrative functions. Here you can manage users, view analytics, and perform other administrative tasks.

```html
<div id="adminDashboard">
  <!-- Administrative controls and information -->
</div>
```

## Maintaining the Website

Maintenance activities can be logged using the `logMaintenanceActivity` function. This function takes a `MaintenanceLogSchema` object as an argument.

```javascript
logMaintenanceActivity({
  // Maintenance log details according to MaintenanceLogSchema
});
```

The maintenance records can be viewed in the element with the ID `maintenanceRecords`.

```html
<div id="maintenanceRecords">
  <!-- Display maintenance logs -->
</div>
```

## Naming Conventions

Refer to the `docs/naming_conventions.md` for guidelines on how to name assets. Use the `validateAssetName` function to ensure that asset names adhere to the established conventions.

```javascript
validateAssetName('exampleAssetName');
```

## Linking Assets

To include correct links in the code, use the `generateLink` function along with the `baseURL` and `assetPrefix` variables.

```javascript
let assetLink = generateLink(baseURL, assetPrefix, 'imageName.png');
```

## Deployment

For deployment instructions, refer to the `docs/deployment_guide.md`. Use the `deploySite` function to deploy the website to the specified URL.

```javascript
deploySite(deploymentConfig);
```

## Software Requirements

Ensure that all software requirements are met as outlined in `docs/software_requirements.md`. This includes necessary libraries, frameworks, and any other tools needed for the website's operation.

For more detailed information on each of these sections, please refer to the respective documentation files linked throughout this manual.
