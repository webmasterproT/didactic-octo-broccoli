# Website Maintenance Guide

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines and procedures for maintaining the website. It includes instructions for logging maintenance activities, updating content, and ensuring the website's smooth operation.

## Maintenance Procedures

### Logging Maintenance Activities

To keep track of maintenance activities, follow the `MaintenanceLogSchema` which outlines the structure for maintenance records. Use the `logMaintenanceActivity` function to add new entries to the log.

```javascript
function logMaintenanceActivity(activityDetails) {
  // Ensure activityDetails follows the MaintenanceLogSchema
  // Add code to log the maintenance activity
  // Update the maintenanceRecords DOM element with the new log entry
}
```

### Regular Checks

Perform regular checks to ensure all website features are functioning correctly. This includes:

- Checking for broken links.
- Ensuring that content is up to date.
- Verifying that user submissions through forms are being processed.

### Updating Content

When updating content on the website:

1. Use the `uploadForm` to upload new assets or content.
2. Ensure that new assets follow the `AssetNamingSchema` and use the `validateAssetName` function to verify names before uploading.

```javascript
function validateAssetName(assetName) {
  // Implement validation logic based on AssetNamingSchema
  // Return true if the asset name is valid, false otherwise
}
```

3. Update links using the `generateLink` function to ensure they point to the correct URLs.

```javascript
function generateLink(assetName) {
  // Use the baseURL and assetPrefix to generate the full URL
  // Return the correct link for the asset
}
```

### Handling Issues

In case of any issues:

- Refer to the `UploadErrorMessage` or `MaintenanceUpdateMessage` to inform users of the current status.
- Use the administration interface accessible through the `adminDashboard` to manage and resolve issues.

## Maintenance Schedule

Set up a maintenance schedule to regularly update and check the website. This includes:

- Weekly checks for content relevance and accuracy.
- Monthly checks for technical updates and security patches.
- Quarterly reviews of website performance and user feedback.

## Conclusion

Regular maintenance is crucial for the website's health and performance. Adhere to the guidelines outlined in this document and use the shared dependencies to ensure consistency and efficiency in maintenance tasks.
